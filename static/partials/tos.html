        which is effective from March 1, 2020.
    </p>

    <h4>Last Revised: February 5, 2015</h4>

    <p>These Quay Terms of Service (these “<strong>Terms</strong>”) apply to the features and functions provided by CoreOS, Inc. (“<strong>CoreOS</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>,” or “<strong>we</strong>”) via quay.io (the “<strong>Site</strong>”) (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>”). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use any of the Services. The “<strong>Effective Date</strong>” of these Terms is the date you first access any of the Services.</p>
    <p>If you are accessing the Services in your capacity as an employee, consultant or agent of a company (or other entity), you represent that you are an employee, consultant or agent of such company (or other entity) and you have the authority to agree (and be legally bound) on behalf of such company (or other entity) to all of the terms and conditions of these Terms.</p>
    <p>For the purpose of these Terms, you and, if applicable, such company (or other entity) constitutes “<strong>Customer</strong>” or “<strong>you</strong>”.</p>
    <p>CoreOS reserves the right to change or modify any of the terms and conditions contained in these Terms (or any policy or guideline of CoreOS) at any time and in its sole discretion by providing notice that these Terms have been modified. Such notice may be provided by sending an email, posting a notice on the Site, posting the revised Terms on the Site and revising the date at the top of these Terms or such other form of notice as determined by CoreOS. Any changes or modifications will be effective 30 days after providing notice that these Terms have been modified (the “<strong>Notice Period</strong>”). Your continued use of any of the Services following the Notice Period will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications. Therefore, you should review these Terms whenever you access the Services and at least every 30 days to make sure that you understand the terms and conditions that will apply to your use of the Services.</p>
    <p>These terms form a binding agreement between you and CoreOS.</p>

        <strong>Your Responsibilities</strong>
    <p>If you share your repository, publish images, code or content, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available by means of the Site (“<strong>Content</strong>”), you are entirely responsible for such Content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content. That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio file, or computer software. By making Content available, you represent and warrant that:</p>
        <ul>
      <li>the downloading, copying and use of the Content will not infringe, violate or misappropriate any Intellectual Property Rights of any third party;</li>
      <li>if your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you have either (a) received permission from your employer to post or make available the Content, including but not limited to any software, or (b) secured from your employer a waiver as to all rights in or to the Content;</li>
      <li>you have fully complied with any third-party licenses relating to the Content, and have done all things necessary to successfully pass through to end users any required terms;</li>
      <li>the Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content;</li>
      <li>the Content is not spam, is not randomly-generated, and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing);</li>
      <li>the Content does not contain threats or incite violence, and does not violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third party;</li>
      <li>your Content is not getting advertised via unwanted electronic messages such as spam links on newsgroups, email lists, other blogs and web sites, and similar unsolicited promotional methods;</li>
      <li>your Content is not named in a manner that misleads your readers into thinking that you are another person or company. For example, your Content’s URL or name is not the name of a person other than yourself or company other than your own; and</li>
      <li>you have, in the case of Content that includes computer code, accurately categorized and/or described the type, nature, uses and effects of the materials, whether requested to do so by CoreOS or otherwise.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By submitting Content or computer code to CoreOS for inclusion in your repositories, you grant CoreOS a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of providing the services you request. If you delete Content, CoreOS will use reasonable efforts to remove it from the Services, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable.</p>
    <p>Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, CoreOS has the right (though not the obligation) to, in CoreOS’ sole discretion (a) refuse or remove any content that, in CoreOS’ reasonable opinion, violates any CoreOS policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (b) terminate or deny access to and use of the Site to any individual or entity for any reason, in CoreOS’ sole discretion. CoreOS will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fees and Payment Terms</strong>
    <p>In exchange for your rights to the Services, you will pay to CoreOS the Subscription Fees. The Subscription Fees do not include taxes, and the Subscription Fees are payable in advance in accordance with your Quay Plan.</p>
    <p>Unless CoreOS states otherwise, all payments must be made (a) in U.S. Dollars; and (b) by payment card via an authorized CoreOS payment processor. If you pay via a payment card, you hereby (i) authorize CoreOS (or its authorized payment processor) to make automatic recurring charges to your designated payment card number in the applicable amount of the Subscription Fees on an annual or monthly basis (as applicable) for the duration of the Subscription Period, (ii) represent and warrant that you are authorized to use and have fees charged to the payment card number you provide to CoreOS, and (iii) understand that you may withdraw this consent by emailing CoreOS at <a href="mailto:support@quay.io">support@quay.io</a>. <strong>Accounts can be canceled at any time in the Plan and Usage section of your Account Settings. No refunds will be issued (unless expressly stated otherwise).</strong></p>
    <p>Notwithstanding any terms to the contrary in these Terms, CoreOS, at its sole discretion, may modify its pricing during any Subscription Period and such modifications will be effective as of the directly subsequent Subscription Period.</p>
    <p>Interest on any late payments will accrue at the rate of 1.5% per month, or the highest rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the date such amount is due until the date such amount is paid in full. You will be responsible for, and will pay all sales and similar taxes on, all license fees and similar fees levied upon the provision of the Services provided under these Terms, excluding only taxes based solely on CoreOS’ net income. You will indemnify and hold CoreOS harmless from and against any and all such taxes and related amounts levied upon the provision of the Services and any costs associated with the collection or withholding thereof, including penalties and interest.</p>
